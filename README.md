# Menu App Bar for latests stock updates - macOS

Easy python menu bar app that returns the latests changes in the stock markets. With this repository, I want to showcase how easy is to generate useful ideas and implement them, plus the importance of the use of APIs in Data Science.

## Requirements

You have to install the following libraries: `rumps` and `alpha_vantage`. You will need to create your own API key, following this [link](https://www.alphavantage.co).

## How to use

Simply run:

`python trading_bar.py`
